###################Kubernetes Architecture 
*Node :
Node(minians) is a worker machine where the containers are launched by kubernetes 

*Cluster:
A cluster is a group of nodes group together, if one node fails then application is accessible from other nodes 

*Master:
Master is also a node with kubernetes installed in it, master node watch all the node and responsible for actual orchestation 

###################Components of kubernetes:

API server : APIserver act as front end for kubernetes user, devices, CLI all talk to the 
API server to intresct with ks8 server

ETCD : is a distributed relible key value store used by ks8 to store all the data, 
and also responsible for emplementing lock within cluster 

Scheduler: Scheduler distribute fork and container accross multiple nodes, 
it find newly created node and assign them to container

controller: controlers are the brain behind the orchestation they re resposnsible for notiching when nodes conatainers or 
endpoint goes down, controllers makes decison to 

Container runtime: container runtime is an underlying software that is used to run containers, can be docker and others 

Kublet: kubelet is an agent that runs on each node
